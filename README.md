# Canada Unknown
## Description
**Technologies used:** HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, MySQL

I developed my frontend and backend skills by designing and coding a website showcasing Canada's lesser known parks. The parks can be browsed either through a list or a map.

The park information is stored in a mySQL database, and served to the website using PHP. I used HTML and CSS to design the site, and JavaScript to make the site responsive across various devices
